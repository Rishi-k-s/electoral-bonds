Torrent Pharma,"In 2019, the firm’s Gujarat manufacturing units were under the scanner after it had to recall its blood pressure medicine, Losartan, from the United States since it was found tainted with a suspected carcinogen. In October that year, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to the firm for repeated quality-related failures at its unit in Dahej. A notice by the US Food and Drug Administration typically attracts an inspection from the state drug regulator, who can issue a separate notice to the company if lapses are detected. In the case of Torrent, the Gujarat drug regulator did not take any action.
That year, the firm purchased bonds worth Rs 12.5 crore – of that Rs 11.5 crore went to the BJP. 
In 2022, another US  Food and Drug Administration inspection also found violations in Torrent’s Indrad facility. The firm donated Rs 25 crore – of that, Rs 22 crore went to the BJP.
Between 2018 and 2023, Torrent received four notices for substandard drugs from the state food and drug administrations of Maharashtra and Gujarat. One of these notices, issued in February 2023, pertained to the Lopamide tablets made in its Gangtok facility.",https://www.newslaundry.com/2024/03/27/of-rs-945-crore-donated-by-drug-firms-most-went-to-parties-governing-states-with-pharma-units,61
